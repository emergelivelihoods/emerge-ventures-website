Here are a few ways to quickly integrate PayChangu into your projects. Once completed, you will be able to receive payments from customers worldwide.

**PayChangu Standard Checkout**

The [Standard Checkout](https://developer.paychangu.com/docs/standard-checkout) integration is simple.

Our primarily client-side integration is simple to implement. Add the JavaScript library to your checkout page and link it to your payment button. When the customer clicks the payment button, our popup will appear on your website to handle the process and redirect you to you upon completion.
