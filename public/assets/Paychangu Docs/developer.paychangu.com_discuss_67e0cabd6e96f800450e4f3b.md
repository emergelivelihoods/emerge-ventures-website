## Escrow Services for Marketplace Payments

3 months ago by Vandross Chowe

We're working on a payment solution for marketplace transactions in Malawi, where buyers pay using Airtel Money or TNM Mpamba, and funds need to be held securely until the purchase is complete, then released to the seller—or returned to the buyer if it falls through. We'd like PayChangu to handle the payment processing and fund management for this.

Is an escrow service (holding funds until release is authorized) already available at PayChangu?

- If yes:
1. How does it work with your API?


     2\. Does it fully support Airtel Money and TNM Mpamba?


     3\. Are there extra fees beyond the standard 3% per transaction?


     4\. How soon could I start testing it in your sandbox?


     \- If no:


     1\. Could PayChangu develop this as a custom feature?


     2\. What would be the setup process and timeline?


     3\. Would there be additional costs for building it?

We're eager to explore using PayChangu for this and would appreciate a reply with details.

Thank you!
