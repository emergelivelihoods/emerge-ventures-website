PayChangu APIs offer powerful payment solutions tailored for your application. Not sure how to start? Visit our [Welcome](https://developer.paychangu.com/docs/welcome) page for a step-by-step guide to begin your integration journey.

PayChangu APIs adhere to RESTful principles for seamless and consistent integration:

1. **Request Methods:** We utilize standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` for communication, with HTTP response codes indicating the status and errors.
2. **Data Format:** All responses are in JSON format. Ensure your API requests include a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.
3. **Authentication:** Every endpoint requires authentication using your API keys. Make sure to securely include them in your requests.
